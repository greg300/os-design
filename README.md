# Operating Systems from Scratch
## CS 416 - Operating System Design

This collection demonstrates various operating system concepts and showcases proof-of-concept, POSIX-like libraries coded from scratch in C.

## Project 1 - System Calls and Signals
A demonstration of basic system calls and signal handling in C, along with timing analysis.

## Project 2 - User-Level Thread Library and Scheduler
An implementation of the POSIX threading library using contexts and signal handling of a timer interrupt. Supports `create`, `exit`, and `join` features; scheduling of threads is also handled.

## Project 3 - User-Level Memory Management Library
An implementation of a basic virtual memory system allowing for `alloc` and `free` operations. Uses page tables and a TLB.

## Project 4 - User-Level Shell
A primitive though fully-operational Unix shell written in C.
